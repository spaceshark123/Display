# Java Display

This project shows custom pixel displays in the console. These images can be **color** or **grayscale** and can be easily customized. 

The built in command line UI allows for converting image files to the console in either display type and optionally copying to clipboard.

Also included are the `Display` and `ColorDisplay` Java classes in which console images are represented. These classes can be imported into your own code for personal use.
